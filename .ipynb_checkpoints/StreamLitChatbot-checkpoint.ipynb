Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\n","primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\n","outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\n","investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\n","and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\n","portant innovations by a wide audience.
